# 👋 Hello there!

## About me 📝
- I'm passionate about creating dynamic and robust web & desktop applications.
- Particularly fond of JavaScript and C#, especially React, Angular, and WPF for the client side, and Node.js & ASP.NET for the server side.
- Constantly learning new technologies and enriching my knowledge base.

## Current Focus 💻
- Currently working on Chess Chatter - a messaging app that combines the excitement of online chess with seamless communication.
- I'm also working on a WhatsApp bot which sends wedding invitations, and logs recipients' responses to a dedicated CSV file. 

## Seeking Opportunities 🔍
- I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute my expertise in React, WPF, Node.js, and ASP.NET.
- If you have a project where my skills could make a difference, I'd love to connect and explore possibilities.
